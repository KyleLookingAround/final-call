# Lessons from each PR

After a PR merges, look back at the session that built it: what it cost, what slowed it, and what would have saved time or credits (the `steward` playbook's last step). Newest first. A lesson marked → changed something, and says where.

## Departures, arrivals and market place, while waiting to merge · 26 Sep 2026

- **Lesson:** each part's session booked its own check-in on its PR, as well as the coordinator's. Each wake re-reads 250–380k tokens of history, and the three would have raced the coordinator to update the same branches. → The coordinator paused them. Parts now subscribe and don't book check-ins (`feature` playbook).

## #21 Baggage system · 26 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** $21.80, 370k of 1M context. Started 20:37, PR opened 21:40, merged 22:14. Three commits, none after the PR opened; CI green first time.
- **Went well:** it stayed in its own file and hooks, and merged cleanly on top of the hotel.
- **Lessons:**
  - It kept running for about 35 minutes after opening its PR, waiting to see it merged. → Parts now subscribe to their PR's events and end their turn (`feature` playbook).
  - It ran the bot's six runs locally, then the Balance workflow ran them again. → Read the workflow's tables instead (`balance` playbook, #20).

## #20 Slimmer project notes and parallel-work lessons · 26 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** written by the coordinating session; one push after the PR opened.
- **Lesson:** a scripted edit left the old playbooks line beside the new one. It was caught by reading the notes back before merging. No change: read the result of any scripted edit to the notes.

## #19 Airport hotel · 26 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** $8.40, 270k of 1M context. Started 20:37, PR opened 21:03, merged 21:14. One commit; CI green first time.
- **Went well:** the cheapest and quickest part. It changed six files with three one-line hooks, and needed nothing at merge.
- **Lesson:** it merged its own PR before the coordinator had reviewed it, because the brief didn't say who merges. → Briefs say to open the PR and stop (`feature` playbook, #20).

## #18 Terminal halls, and running five parts at once · 26 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** the coordinating session had cost $134 over 11 hours by then, against $8–22 for a whole part. Five parts plus the coordinator ran past the five-hour usage limit within the hour.
- **Lessons:**
  - A long conversation re-reads its whole history every turn, so it's the biggest cost. → Keep the coordinator short and start it fresh per feature (`feature` playbook, #20).
  - The parts started from the groundwork branch before it was squash-merged, so each one looked conflicted everywhere. → Merge the groundwork first, and use `git merge -s ours` for parts already started (`steward` playbook, #20).
  - Two parts each spent the whole `perf` headroom. → Give each part a share (`feature` playbook, #20).
  - The `news` check's click timed out once in a full run for departures and once for the coordinator, and passed alone. It waits fixed times rather than for the page's state. → To fix when the parts come together.
