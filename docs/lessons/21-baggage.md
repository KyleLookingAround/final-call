# #21 Baggage system · 26 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** $21.80, 370k of 1M context. Started 20:37, PR opened 21:40, merged 22:14. Three commits, none after the PR opened; CI green first time.
- **Went well:** it stayed in its own file and hooks, and merged cleanly on top of the hotel.
- **Lessons:**
  - It kept running for about 35 minutes after opening its PR, waiting to see it merged. → Parts now subscribe to their PR's events and end their turn (`feature` playbook).
  - It ran the bot's six runs locally, then the Balance workflow ran them again. → Read the workflow's tables instead (`balance` playbook, #20).
