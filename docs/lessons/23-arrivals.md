# #23 Arrivals · 27 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** $11.10, 245k of 1M context. Started 20:36, PR opened about 21:50, merged 05:55 the next morning. Four pushes after it opened, all by the finishing session; CI green after each.
- **Went well:** its rules got their own check group, and it needed no new hooks.
- **Lessons:**
  - The merge with main had two conflicts. Both came from parts moving the same drawing loops out of `12-drawing.js`. The brief named the resolution in advance, so it took minutes.
  - A baggage check set `R.pax` aside for three minutes, then put the old list back. That lost anyone who spawned meanwhile, and their flights never boarded, which jammed the next check. It passed on `main` only by luck of the dice. → The check now merges what arrived meanwhile (`tools/checks/baggage.mjs`).
  - Brought in with main, seed 1 reached level 1 at hour 56, outside the baseline. It was left for the rebalance with every part in, where it came back to 40.
