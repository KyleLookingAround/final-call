# #24 Market place · 26–27 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** $18.30, 383k of 1M context. Started 20:37, PR opened about 21:55, merged 23:45. Three pushes after it opened; CI red twice before that (perf and one market rule).
- **Lessons:**
  - Departures got passengers airside sooner. Under both late and standard gate calls, everyone then had time for a first shop visit, so late calls no longer meant more shopping. → The chance of browsing again now grows with the time until the gate call. A rule that depends on another part's timing needs a check that runs with both parts in, which the part checks gave.
  - The hotel check counted rooms kept for crews as free. → Fixed in the check.
  - The baggage transfer check measured a courier's cost as the change in cash, and more shopping outweighed it. → It checks the `costs` spend itself.
