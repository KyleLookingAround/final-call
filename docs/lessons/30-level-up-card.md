# #30 Level-up card · 27 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** the same session as #28. It was built while #28's CI ran, opened at 06:45 and merged at about 06:58. No pushes after it opened, and CI was green first time. The session's cost is in the entry above.
- **Went well:** the unlocks come from the data the game already gates on (`STAND[i].lvl`, `capAt`, `TECH` tiers, `itemName`). The card and the game can't disagree about what a level opens, and the check asserts it against the same tables.
- **Lessons:**
  - Titles built with `aL()` carry HTML, and one went in through `textContent`; the check caught the raw `<b>`. → No change: the check compares the title text.
  - Proving play unchanged took one `PLAY` comparison instead of a hand diff of saved states, thanks to #28's lesson.
