# #33 Level-up redesign · 27 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** asked for by the owner at about 07:00; opened 07:07, merged 07:15. One push after it opened, which removed the stray `docs/graph.json`; CI green both times.
- **Went well:** screenshots at five sizes, plus one scrolled to the chips, caught an overflowing footer button at 320 px and a cramped landscape header before the PR opened.
- **Lesson:** screenshots taken with the frame loop stopped don't always show a scroll made just before them. → No change: wait a moment after scrolling, as `build/` scripts now do.
