# Real airport groundwork, spec and parts' briefs · 27 Sep 2026

- **Numbers:** session `session_01FzgcmHBgyerAkkyLvdb5kW`, estimate $20: $5.95 and 262k of 1M context by the merge ($1.55 and 149k when the PR opened). PR #38 opened 11:24, merged 11:30; CI green first time (Checks in 6 minutes, Balance's six runs in 3½). Started 07:35; the session was resumed several times, so the wall-clock time says little. No questions for the owner.
- **The knowledge graph:** three queries (`12-drawing.js`, `40-layout-drawing.js`, `perf`) named every file it needed. It read four source files whole (`12-drawing.js`, `13-camera.js`, `40-layout-drawing.js` and `check.mjs`'s perf group) and grepped for the rest, against eight to ten files for each terminal part. `perf`'s answer named the simulation's functions but not that it times only `update()`: drawing had no speed check at all, which only reading the check showed.
- **Lessons:**
  - `perf` measures the simulation, and the real airport only draws, so its headroom was the wrong budget to share. → A `scene` check now times drawing a frame against the same calibration, and the spec shares that headroom instead (`docs/specs/real-airport.md`).
  - The first drawing timings were ten times too fast: `clampCam` works out the view from the zoom before clamping it, so one call from zoom 0.01 put the camera far off the map and almost nothing was drawn. Caught because the lighting check read black pixels. → The check calls it twice; a timing that looks too good is checked against a screenshot.
  - The local `origin/main` was still the first commit, so branching from it emptied the tree. → Fetch `main` before branching from `origin/main`.
